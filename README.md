# Exalted-Character-Sheet
This project, once the website portfolio is finished, will be used for exalted 2e character sessions.

## The program should have the following:

[] 1. It should track all the attributes, abilities, essence rating, essence pools (personal | peripheral), will power, health levels, and defense values.

[] 2. There should be input areas that allow one to create a name, physical descriptions, and exaltation type and caste (lunar | new moon).

[] 3. It should have a way for one to save their character, and load it.

[] 4. There should be a text area for pasting charm descriptions, as well as an input to optionally put in the name of a charm

[] 5. When the charm is input, it should lower the essence pool, health levels, or will power depending on the cost of the charm

[] 6. Three should be a rest drop down option that allows the person to select a number of hours - complete refresh and refills essence pools and heals health/will power pools depending on recovery rate.

[] 7. Health Level boxes should have 3 clickable options:
   a. one click should have a "B" for bashing, two clicks should have an "L" for lethal, and three "A" for aggravated damage.

[] 8. relating to charms, the charm text area should have a button that sifts through the charm description for attribute and abilities then outputs how many dice the player needs to roll.

[] 9. three should be a drop down menu for excellencies, along with a drop down quantity that increases or decreases the dice pool output of said charms.

[] 10. charms that have output dice pools previously should have a history, similar to a calculator or phone history result list, that show the title of the charm and how many dice were rolled previously as a simple tool to recall those rolls.

[] 11. lastly, there should be a limit break meter, and a set of buttons: 1st social defense of the scene, full moon, and going against motivation. All of these should increase the limit break meter.

[] 12. When the limit meter fills, empty it, and clear out will power meter as a way to enact the limit break scene.
